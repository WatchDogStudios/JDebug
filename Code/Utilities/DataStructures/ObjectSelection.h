/// \brief Stores a list of game objects as a 'selection' for editor tools and gameplay systems.

/// systems that need to maintain groups of objects, such as unit selection in strategy games,
/// inventory systems, or quest target tracking.

/// The selection automatically handles validation of object handles and provides utilities for
/// common selection operations like adding, removing, and toggling objects.
