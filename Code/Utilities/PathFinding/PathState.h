/// A path state generator is a class that takes one 'path state' (typically a node in a graph) and generates all the adjacent nodes
/// that can be reached from there. It carries state, which allows to expand nodes only in certain directions, depending on what actions
/// are possible at some graph node.
///
/// This can be used to do path searches where the capabilities of a unit are taken into account, such as limited turning speeds.
/// The 'state' that is then carried is the current orientation of the unit at that point along the path, which determines into which
/// directions the path search can be expanded.
///
/// PathStateType needs to be derived from nsPathState.
